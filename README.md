# Precised-Agriculture
Agriculture is one of the sectors where most people are dependent on it
for their livelihood. Crop production is influenced by a variety of seasonal,
economic, and biological patterns, yet unforeseen variations in these
patterns result in significant losses for farmers. When appropriate
procedures are used on data linked to soil type, temperature, air
pressure, humidity, and crop type, these hazards can be mitigated. Crop
and weather forecasting, on the other hand, may be forecasted by
obtaining helpful insights from agricultural data that help farmers pick
which crop to plant for the future year in order to maximise profit. This
study provides an overview of the various weather, agricultural yield, and
crop cost prediction algorithms.
